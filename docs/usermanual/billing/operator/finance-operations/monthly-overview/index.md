`Monthly Overview` is used to review monthly billing cycles, tenant settlement status, monthly gross flow, payable amounts, platform retained fee, revenue mix, and pending settlement tasks. Operators use this page to decide whether settlement statements can be generated or whether exceptions need follow-up first.


#### Beginner Explanation

Monthly Overview is like the billing-cycle monthly report. Select a billing cycle first, then check how many tenants are settled, how many still need follow-up, and how platform revenue is composed. If To generate or To advance is not zero, continue with settlement list or reconciliation pages before final actions.

#### Terms Quick Reference

| Term | Meaning | Handling tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Billing Cycle | The month or settlement period used for billing, revenue, and reconciliation. | Keep the cycle consistent across Monthly Overview, Settlement List, and Financial Accounts. |
| Tenant settlement status | Settlement progress for tenants in the selected billing cycle. | Check Pending Tenants and Failed before generating statements. |
| Revenue Mix | Platform retained fee, self-operated revenue, and total statistical revenue. | Treat it as a summary and reconcile abnormal amounts with details. |
| Task List | To generate, To advance, and Long unresolved task counts. | Use it to decide the next downstream page. |

## Pitfalls

- Do not rely on one amount field alone for financial confirmation; cross-check transactions, bills, settlement statements, and reconciliation results.
- Do not repeat high-risk billing operations when the first attempt fails; check status and error details first.
- Remove sensitive customer, bank, contract, token, Key, or internal processing information before sharing screenshots or tickets.
- `Generate Settlement` affects the real billing-cycle settlement flow.
- Before clicking `Generate Settlement`, confirm the billing cycle, tenant scope, To generate count, failed tasks, and reconciliation status.
- Do not click generation repeatedly. If it fails, check Settlement List or Reconciliation Center before retrying.

## Result Validation

| Check Item | Success Signal | If Abnormal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Billing-period switch | The statistic cards and task list update after the billing period changes. | Select the billing period again and refresh. |
| Page refresh | The loading state clears after you click Refresh. | Check the network, permissions, and background task status. |
| Settlement generation | Settlement List shows a record or status change for the selected billing period. | Open Settlement List and check the generation result. |

## FAQ

#### The To Generate Count Is Not Zero

**Symptom:** The task list still shows items to generate.

**Possible causes:** Some tenants do not yet have settlement statements, billing data aggregation is incomplete, or a preceding reconciliation exception exists.

**Resolution:**

1. Confirm that the selected billing period is correct.
2. Check the billing-period statistics before selecting `Generate Settlement`.
3. After generation, open Settlement List and track settlement status.

#### The Revenue Mix Is Unexpected

**Symptom:** Platform retained fees, self-operated revenue, or total statistical revenue differs from expectations.

**Possible causes:** The billing period is incorrect, aggregation is incomplete, or adjustments and reconciliation exceptions affect the statistics.

**Resolution:**

1. Check the billing period.
2. Open Financial Accounts and review account transactions and trends.
3. Open Reconciliation Center and check for exceptions.

#### Generate Settlement Is Unavailable

**Symptom:** `Generate Settlement` cannot be selected or does not proceed.

**Possible causes:** Statistics are incomplete, the current account lacks permission, or exceptions and pending tasks block the billing period.

**Resolution:**

1. Confirm whether billing-period statistics are complete.
2. Check pending and failed counts in the task list.
3. If permission is missing, ask the platform administrator for finance-operations permission.

#### Task Counts Do Not Match Settlement List

**Symptom:** To Generate, To Advance, or Long Unresolved counts differ from filtered results in Settlement List.

**Possible causes:** The pages use different billing periods or statuses, Monthly Overview is delayed, or Settlement List updated before the overview refreshed.

**Resolution:**

1. Use the same billing period and status filters on both pages.
2. Click **"Refresh"** in Monthly Overview.
3. If the difference remains, open Reconciliation Center and check background tasks or exceptions.


#### When Is Monthly Overview Ready for Settlement?

**Symptom:**

Monthly Overview shows data, but it is unclear whether settlement generation can continue.

**Possible causes:**

- Billing-cycle statistics are not complete.
- Today Tasks or Reconciliation Center still has blocking exceptions.

**How to handle:**

1. Confirm the target billing cycle, update time, and statistics status.
2. Check high-priority items in Today Tasks.
3. Refresh Reconciliation Center and confirm that no blocking exception remains.
4. Enter settlement generation only after all checks pass.
## Notes

- Billing amounts, settlements, balances, and customer information are sensitive. Desensitize them before sharing.
- Keep page routes, API fields, Key, AK/SK, License, and other product terms in their UI form.
- Do not record real billing-cycle amounts, tenants, tenants, customer names, settlement statement numbers, internal transaction numbers, or approval information in the manual, screenshots, notes, or tickets.

## Next Steps

1. Review related billing records, transactions, settlement statements, and account balance changes.
2. Keep only desensitized page paths, timestamps, status values, and screenshots when escalating.
3. Continue with the related reconciliation, settlement, top-up, or adjustment flow after the result is confirmed.
