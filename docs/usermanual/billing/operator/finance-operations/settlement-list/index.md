`Settlement List` is used to search, generate, and track tenant settlement statements. Billing operators can filter settlement statements by billing cycle, status, and tenant, open details to verify amount, status, and posting confirmation, and start the settlement generation flow from this page.


#### Beginner Explanation

Settlement List is like a settlement work order pool. Each settlement statement usually represents one tenant in one billing cycle. Operators use the statement status to understand whether it has been generated, is waiting for posting confirmation, has been settled, or has failed.

Settlement List is not a complete finance backend. It provides entries for viewing, generating, and tracking settlement statements. Amounts, status, and posting confirmation should be cross-checked with [Monthly Overview](../monthly-overview/), [Financial Accounts](../financial-accounts/), and [Reconciliation Center](../reconciliation-center/).

#### Terms Quick Reference

| Term | Meaning | Handling tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settlement statement | A settlement record for an tenant in a billing cycle. | Open details to verify amount and status. |
| Billing Cycle | The month or settlement period of the statement. | Keep it consistent with Monthly Overview. |
| Posting confirmation | The finance-side status for confirming whether funds have been posted. | Check Financial Accounts if it remains unchanged for a long time. |
| Payable amount | The amount payable to the tenant in the current settlement statement. | Cross-check it with Monthly Overview and account flows. |
| Settlement status | The processing stage of the settlement statement. | Decide the next action based on status. |
| Generation Checks | Pre-generation checks before creating settlement statements. | Do not submit repeatedly when checks fail. |
| Settlement Preview | Preview of settlement scope and amount before submission. | Verify tenant and billing cycle again before submitting. |

### Generate Settlement

#### Pre-operation Checks

Before generating a settlement statement, confirm that:

1. Statistics for the target billing cycle have been completed.
2. The target tenant scope has been confirmed.
3. No obvious exception exists in `Monthly Overview`.
4. `Financial Accounts` and `Reconciliation Center` have no blocking exceptions.
5. The current account has permission to generate settlement statements.

#### Steps

6. Go to `Billing > Finance Operations > Settlement List`.
7. Click **"Generate Settlement"**.
8. Select the target `Billing Cycle` and `Tenant`.

   The following screenshot shows selecting billing cycle and tenant. Use it to specify the settlement scope.

12. After submission, return to the settlement list and search by billing cycle and tenant.
13. Click **"Details"** to confirm settlement status, amount, and posting confirmation information.

#### Risk Notes

- Do not generate settlement statements before billing-cycle data is verified.
- Do not repeatedly generate statements for the same tenant and billing cycle.
- If generation fails, check generation checks, settlement details, or Reconciliation Center before retrying.
- `Submit` is a high-risk final action.
- Do not record real bank accounts, contract numbers, customer names, settlement statement numbers, internal transaction numbers, approval comments, accounts, tokens, or keys.

## Pitfalls

- Do not rely on one amount field alone for financial confirmation; cross-check transactions, bills, settlement statements, and reconciliation results.
- Do not repeat high-risk billing operations when the first attempt fails; check status and error details first.
- Remove sensitive customer, bank, contract, token, Key, or internal processing information before sharing screenshots or tickets.
- `Generate Settlement` affects the real billing-cycle settlement flow.
- `Submit` is a high-risk final action.
- If generation fails, investigate Generation Checks, settlement details, or Reconciliation Center first. Do not submit repeatedly.
- Do not record real bank accounts, contract numbers, customer names, settlement statement numbers, internal transaction numbers, approval comments, accounts, tokens, or keys.

## FAQ

#### The Target Settlement Statement Cannot Be Found

**Symptom:** The list does not show the target statement after a search by billing period or tenant.

**Possible causes:** The billing period is incorrect, the status filter is too narrow, or no statement has been generated for the tenant.

**Resolution:**

1. Click **"Reset"** to clear the filters.
2. Select the billing period again and search.
3. Return to Monthly Overview and confirm that statistics are complete for the billing period.
4. Generate a statement only after the pre-operation checks confirm that one is required.

#### Settlement Status Has Not Changed for a Long Time

**Symptom:** The statement remains Processing or Posting Confirmation for a long time.

**Possible causes:** Posting confirmation is incomplete, downstream account processing is delayed, or an exception requires operator handling.

**Resolution:**

1. Open settlement details and review status information.
2. Open Financial Accounts and check account transactions and posting status.
3. Open Reconciliation Center and check for unmatched transfers or missing revenue details.

#### Generate Settlement Is Unavailable

**Symptom:** The button cannot be selected or does not open the generation flow.

**Possible causes:** The current account lacks permission, billing-period statistics are incomplete, or current page state does not meet generation conditions.

**Resolution:**

1. Confirm that the current account has finance-operations generation permission.
2. Return to Monthly Overview and check billing-period statistics.
3. Clear the filters, refresh, and open the generation flow again.

#### The Settlement Amount Is Unexpected

**Symptom:** The payable tenant amount differs from the expected amount or Monthly Overview.

**Possible causes:** The billing period, tenant, or settlement definition differs; statistics are incomplete; or unmatched transfers, missing revenue details, or account exceptions exist.

**Resolution:**

1. Confirm that the statement and Monthly Overview use the same billing period and tenant.
2. Open Financial Accounts and check account transactions.
3. Open Reconciliation Center and review exception items.
4. Do not archive or deliver the statement to Finance until the difference is resolved.

#### Settlement Generation Fails

**Symptom:** Submission fails or the statement status is Failed.

**Possible causes:** Generation checks found a blocking exception, billing-period or tenant data is incomplete, or a statement already exists for the same tenant and billing period.

**Resolution:**

1. Review generation checks and the failure message.
2. Open Reconciliation Center and investigate unmatched transfers, missing revenue details, or other exceptions.
3. Confirm that no duplicate statement exists before starting generation again.
4. Do not select the generation action repeatedly.

#### Can a Settlement Statement Be Generated Repeatedly?

**Symptom:** A statement already exists for the tenant and billing period, and the operator is unsure whether another can be generated.

**Possible causes:** Generation rules are unclear, the existing statement has an abnormal status or amount, or pre-generation checks are incomplete.

**Resolution:**

1. Search for the existing statement by billing period and tenant.
2. Open details and confirm its status and amount.
3. If correction is required, check Monthly Overview, Financial Accounts, and Reconciliation Center first.
4. Do not generate another statement for the same tenant and billing period until the rule and required action are confirmed.

3. Open [Reconciliation Center](../reconciliation-center/) when a financial exception exists.
