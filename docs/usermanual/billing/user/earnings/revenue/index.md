`Revenue` is used to view Provider revenue overview, revenue account balance, current month estimate, billing cycle analysis, revenue account activity, settlements, and customer revenue details. Provider accounts can use this page to understand revenue trends, verify revenue account activity, and reconcile revenue with monthly settlements and customer details.


#### Beginner Explanation

Revenue works like a Provider earnings dashboard. Start with revenue account balance and current month estimate, then use billing cycle analysis to review daily revenue, top customers, and top models. For reconciliation, switch to Revenue Account Activity or open settlements and customer details.

- Do not rely on revenue account balance alone. Cross-check revenue account activity, monthly settlements, and customer details.
- Current month estimate changes with consumption and settlement processing. Do not treat it as final credited amount.
- Empty Top Customers or Top Models is not always abnormal. Confirm whether the selected billing cycle has real revenue first.
- Revenue account balance, activity amount, customer name, billing cycle, and settlement status are sensitive. Desensitize screenshots, exports, tickets, and comments.
- Before exporting revenue data, verify the billing cycle, account permission, data scope, and recipient.

## FAQ

#### Revenue balance does not match the expected value

The balance or estimated revenue in Revenue Overview differs from internal records.

**How to check:**

Confirm the billing cycle first, then check `Revenue Account Activity`, `Settlements`, and `Customers` to compare source, status, and customer-level data.

#### Top Customers or Top Models is empty

The customer ranking or model ranking in billing cycle analysis has no data.

**How to check:**

Switch to a billing cycle with existing revenue. If other metrics are also empty, check account permission and page loading status.

#### Revenue Account Activity list is empty

No activity record appears after switching to `Revenue Account Activity`.

**How to check:**

Return to Revenue Overview to check settlement history, then open monthly settlements to verify whether the corresponding billing cycle has been settled.


#### Revenue Does Not Update After Refresh

**Symptom:**

The amount, count, or status in Revenue remains unchanged after the related process finishes.

**Possible causes:**

- The billing cycle, tenant, customer, or business scope does not match the processed object.
- An upstream statistics, posting, or settlement task is still running.
- The current account can view only part of the data scope.

**How to handle:**

1. Recheck the billing cycle and object scope in Revenue.
2. Refresh the page, reopen the target record, and verify the update time.
3. Cross-check the upstream status in Revenue Account Activity and Settlements.
4. If the value still does not update, provide authorized personnel with the desensitized billing cycle, object identifier, status, and update time.

#### What Must Be Checked Before Sharing Revenue Information?

**Symptom:**

Revenue results must be shared in a screenshot, ticket, or report.

**Possible causes:**

- Revenue balances, billing-cycle amounts, customers, models, and settlement statuses may be sensitive billing information.
- The sharing scope may exceed the recipient's business permission.
- A full screenshot may include account, environment, or unrelated information.

**How to handle:**

1. Keep only fields, statuses, and time ranges required for troubleshooting.
2. Use the specified light-gray opaque small-pixel mosaic only on sensitive text and values.
3. Confirm that the screenshot does not contain top-menu account data, environment information, real credentials, or internal addresses.
4. Share with the minimum required audience and record the desensitized scope.
## Notes

- Revenue Overview is a summary view. Final reconciliation should use revenue account activity, settlements, and customer details together.
- Revenue account balance, activity amount, customer name, account, billing cycle, transaction number, and settlement statement number are sensitive. Do not share them directly.
- Desensitize screenshots, exports, tickets, and comments.
- Do not record real customer names, accounts, amounts, transaction numbers, settlement statement numbers, Token, or Key.

## Next Steps

1. To verify settlement status, go to [Settlements](../settlements/).
2. To verify revenue by customer, go to [Customers](../customers/).
3. To troubleshoot revenue account activity, keep only desensitized page paths, billing cycles, and status information.
