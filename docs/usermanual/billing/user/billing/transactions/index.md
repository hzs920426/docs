| Managed objects | Income records, expense records, transaction context, and business transaction numbers |

The `Transactions` page is titled `Income & Expense Details` in the UI and is used to query billing records for the current account. Filter by transaction type, income/expense direction, and time range, then review transaction number, occurrence time, transaction type, context, credit change, post-change credits, business transaction number, remarks, and details.


#### Beginner Explanation

Transactions is the account's receipt list. Every balance increase or decrease should have a corresponding record here. When troubleshooting a balance, do not rely only on Account Overview; use Transactions to filter by time, direction, and transaction type.

#### Terms Quick Reference

| Term | Meaning | Handling Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Income/Expense Type | Indicates whether the record increases or decreases the balance. | Check direction before transaction type. |
| Transaction Type | Business category such as transfer, consumption, refund, or adjustment. | Use it to narrow the search. |
| Credit Change | Credits added or deducted by this record. | Review it with Post-change Credits. |
| Business Transaction Number | Number of the related business transaction. | It is not the payment transaction number. |
| Post-change Credits | Account Credits after this transaction. | Use it to explain a balance change. |

## Prerequisites

1. The current account has permission to view user-side billing.
2. Open `My Billing > Transactions`.
3. Confirm the time range to query.
4. Use sanitized transaction numbers in external communication.

## Page Description

The page contains filters and a transaction list. Filter by `Transaction Type`, `Income/Expense Type`, and time range, then use `Search` or `Reset`. The table shows transaction number, occurrence time, direction, type, context, credit change, post-change credits, business transaction number, remarks, and operation.

The following screenshot shows Transactions. Sanitize transaction numbers, times, context, and amounts before sharing it.

## Main Operations

### Reconcile a Balance Change

1. Select a transaction and record quota before, direction, change amount, and quota after.
2. Compare adjacent transactions for balance continuity and check for top-ups, refunds, or adjustments.
3. When ordered correctly, one transaction's quota after should equal the next transaction's quota before. If not, check sorting and delayed posting.
4. If it cannot be explained, escalate with a redacted transaction number and time range. Do not create a top-up or adjustment directly.

## Pitfalls

- A business transaction number is not a payment transaction number and may not be a top-up order number.
- One transaction explains one credit change; use Monthly Bill for monthly totals.
- Income, expense, refund, and reversal directions are easy to confuse. Check transaction type before interpreting the amount.
- If a transaction is missing, widen the time range before concluding that data was lost.
- Do not record real accounts, emails, order numbers, transaction numbers, amounts, customer names, tenant names, Tokens, or Keys.
- Sanitize screenshots, exports, tickets, and comments.

## Result Validation

| Detail entry | Row-level `Details` opens the individual transaction. | Check permission or contact the operator with a sanitized transaction number. |
| Transaction export controlled | Transactions are exported only by authorized users for the confirmed scope. | If an unintended export occurs, record the time and scope and notify the owner for review. |

## FAQ

#### A Target Transaction Cannot Be Found

**Symptom:**

No target record appears after filtering by transaction type, direction, or time range.

**Possible Causes:**

The time range is too narrow, filters do not match, or the related transaction has not posted yet.

**Solution:**

Clear filters, widen the time range, and contact the operator with a sanitized order number or business record if the transaction is still missing.

#### Transaction Direction Differs from Expectations

**Symptom:**

A record is shown as income or expense, but the direction looks wrong.

**Possible Causes:**

Transaction type, refund, reversal, transfer, or adjustment can change the direction.

**Solution:**

Review transaction type and context, then compare the business transaction number with Monthly Bill and Account Overview.

#### Transaction Totals Differ from Monthly Bill

**Symptom:**

The sum of filtered transactions differs from the Monthly Bill summary.

**Possible Causes:**

The billing cycle, time range, transaction type, or statistical scope differs between pages.

**Solution:**

Align the billing cycle and time range, refresh Monthly Bill, and group the comparison by transaction type when needed.


#### Transactions Does Not Update After Refresh

**Symptom:**

The amount, count, or status in Transactions remains unchanged after the related process finishes.

**Possible causes:**

- The billing cycle, tenant, customer, or business scope does not match the processed object.
- An upstream statistics, posting, or settlement task is still running.
- The current account can view only part of the data scope.

**How to handle:**

1. Recheck the billing cycle and object scope in Transactions.
2. Refresh the page, reopen the target record, and verify the update time.
3. Cross-check the upstream status in Account Overview and Monthly Bill.
4. If the value still does not update, provide authorized personnel with the desensitized billing cycle, object identifier, status, and update time.

#### What Must Be Checked Before Sharing Transactions Information?

**Symptom:**

Transactions results must be shared in a screenshot, ticket, or report.

**Possible causes:**

- Transaction numbers, amounts, transaction types, accounts, and related records may be sensitive billing information.
- The sharing scope may exceed the recipient's business permission.
- A full screenshot may include account, environment, or unrelated information.

**How to handle:**

1. Keep only fields, statuses, and time ranges required for troubleshooting.
2. Use the specified light-gray opaque small-pixel mosaic only on sensitive text and values.
3. Confirm that the screenshot does not contain top-menu account data, environment information, real credentials, or internal addresses.
4. Share with the minimum required audience and record the desensitized scope.
## Notes

- Transaction numbers, business transaction numbers, context, and amounts are sensitive billing information and must be sanitized before sharing.
- Do not use one transaction to explain an entire month; compare it with Monthly Bill.
- When an anomaly is found, record the filters and a sanitized transaction identifier before contacting the operator.
- Before exporting transactions, verify the filters, data scope, and recipient permission, and redact transaction numbers, accounts, and amounts.

## Next Steps

1. To verify a top-up transaction, open [Top-up Orders](../top-up-orders/).
2. To reconcile the monthly summary, open [Monthly Bill](../monthly-bill/).
3. To review balance status, open [Account Overview](../overview/).
