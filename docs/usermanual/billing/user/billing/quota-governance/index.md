`Quota Governance` displays quota usage, available balance, and risk state by project and member in the current billing cycle. Use it to identify projects or members approaching their quota limit and adjust usage plans before business is affected.


#### Beginner Explanation

Quota Governance is the usage dashboard for billing. Account balance shows how many Credits remain, while Quota Governance shows which projects or members use the quota, whether they are close to the limit, and which risks need attention first.

#### Terms Quick Reference

| Term | Meaning | Handling Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Billing-cycle Quota | Quota limit available in the current billing cycle. | Confirm the cycle before troubleshooting. |
| Usage Percentage | Used quota divided by the quota limit. | Prioritize items close to the limit. |
| Risk Queue | Overage, near-limit, or pending items that require attention. | Handle them by business impact. |
| Action | Recommended handling for a risk item. | Confirm permission before changing a rule. |
| Available Quota | Quota still available in the current dimension. | Do not treat it as the account balance. |

## Prerequisites

1. The current account has permission to view user-side billing.
2. Open `My Billing > Quota Governance`.
3. Confirm the current billing-cycle range.
4. To change quota rules, the account must have the corresponding management permission.

::: warning High-risk Operation Boundary
Quota adjustments, per-project reset, project defaults, or alert-threshold changes can affect the real available quota of projects and members. This page explains viewing and confirmation only; it does not guide final submission.

## Page Description

The page contains `Billing-cycle Quota Usage`, `Current Quota Status`, and `Risk & Action Queue`. Current Quota Status switches between `Project` and `Member` and provides `Reset by Project`, `Project Defaults`, and row-level `View` entries.

The following screenshot shows Quota Governance. Sanitize project, member, quota, and usage data before sharing it.

## Pitfalls

- Project and member dimensions are different statistical views; do not add their values together.
- Quota Governance displays limits and levels; it does not mean a top-up, deduction, or settlement occurred.
- Risk items may remain briefly after handling. Return to the current cycle and refresh.
- Confirm affected objects before changing quota rules so running workloads or team members are not disrupted.
- Do not record real accounts, emails, order numbers, transaction numbers, amounts, customer names, tenant names, Tokens, or Keys.
- Sanitize screenshots, exports, tickets, and comments.

## Result Validation

| Check Item | Success Signal | If Abnormal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page loading | Billing-cycle usage, current quota status, and risk queue are displayed. | Refresh the page or check user-side billing permission. |
| Dimension switching | `Project` and `Member` views can be selected. | Check page permission and loading state. |
| List fields | Current cycle, used/limit, handling method, available quota, and state are visible. | Ask the operator to confirm quota rules. |
| Detail entry | Row-level `View` opens project or member details. | Check account permission or page loading state. |
| Quota changes controlled | Project resets, default changes, and quota adjustments are performed only by authorized users for the confirmed scope. | If an unintended action occurs, record the time and scope and notify the owner for review. |

## FAQ

#### A Project Is Close to Its Quota Limit

**Symptom:**

The project view shows usage close to or at the quota limit.

**Possible Causes:**

Recent project workload increased or the quota limit is below current business demand.

**Solution:**

Review the project's consumption sources, pause nonessential workloads, and contact the operator through the approved process if the quota must be adjusted.

#### Member and Project Quotas Look Inconsistent

**Symptom:**

Quota levels differ between member and project views.

**Possible Causes:**

The views aggregate different objects: one by project and the other by member.

**Solution:**

Confirm the current dimension and evaluate its used/limit values. Do not add the values from both views together.

#### A Risk Item Does Not Clear Automatically

**Symptom:**

The risk queue still shows an item after it was handled.

**Possible Causes:**

Data refresh is delayed or the action did not cover every affected object.

**Solution:**

Refresh the page and review the current billing cycle again. If the risk remains, open the related project or member details.


#### Quota Governance Does Not Update After Refresh

**Symptom:**

The amount, count, or status in Quota Governance remains unchanged after the related process finishes.

**Possible causes:**

- The billing cycle, tenant, customer, or business scope does not match the processed object.
- An upstream statistics, posting, or settlement task is still running.
- The current account can view only part of the data scope.

**How to handle:**

1. Recheck the billing cycle and object scope in Quota Governance.
2. Refresh the page, reopen the target record, and verify the update time.
3. Cross-check the upstream status in Account Overview and member quotas.
4. If the value still does not update, provide authorized personnel with the desensitized billing cycle, object identifier, status, and update time.

#### What Must Be Checked Before Sharing Quota Governance Information?

**Symptom:**

Quota Governance results must be shared in a screenshot, ticket, or report.

**Possible causes:**

- Project names, members, quotas, usage rates, and risk statuses may be sensitive billing information.
- The sharing scope may exceed the recipient's business permission.
- A full screenshot may include account, environment, or unrelated information.

**How to handle:**

1. Keep only fields, statuses, and time ranges required for troubleshooting.
2. Use the specified light-gray opaque small-pixel mosaic only on sensitive text and values.
3. Confirm that the screenshot does not contain top-menu account data, environment information, real credentials, or internal addresses.
4. Share with the minimum required audience and record the desensitized scope.
## Notes

- Quota Governance is for risk assessment and is not a top-up or deduction page.
- Before changing a quota rule, confirm the affected scope, billing cycle, and business priority.
- Do not expose complete member, project, quota-limit, or consumption details in communication.
- Before resetting projects, changing defaults, or adjusting quotas, verify the target, account permission, and impact scope.
