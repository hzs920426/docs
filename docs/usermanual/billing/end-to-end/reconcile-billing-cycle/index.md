| Workflow Objects | Monthly Overview, Today Tasks, Financial Accounts, reconciliation exceptions, settlement statements, and account adjustment |

This page describes the main workflow for billing operators to complete one billing-cycle reconciliation and settlement: review the billing-cycle summary and today's tasks, check financial accounts and reconciliation exceptions, generate or view settlement statements after blocking issues are cleared, and use account adjustment only when a verified difference still exists.

#### Beginner Explanation

Billing-cycle reconciliation is like month-end closing. First check whether the monthly totals look reasonable, then check pending tasks and exceptions, then reconcile account transactions, and finally generate or confirm settlement statements. Account adjustment is not a routine step; use it only after the difference is located and approval basis is sufficient.

## Main Operations

### View Monthly Overview

1. Open [Monthly Overview](../../operator/finance-operations/monthly-overview/).
2. Select the target billing cycle.
3. Review billing-cycle status, income, expense, net change, exception count, and update time.
4. If billing-cycle statistics are not complete, do not make a settlement conclusion yet.

### Check Today Tasks

1. Open [Today Tasks](../../operator/finance-operations/today-tasks/).
2. Check whether timeout tasks, amount-related tasks, or high-priority tasks exist.
3. Prioritize tasks that may affect monthly closing, settlement statement generation, posting confirmation, or reconciliation results.
4. After handling tasks, return to Monthly Overview and confirm whether billing-cycle status changed.

### Check Financial Accounts

1. Open [Financial Accounts](../../operator/finance-operations/financial-accounts/).
2. Review Platform Clearing Account, Platform Revenue Account, and other accounts for balance, income, expense, and update time.
3. Open transactions and reconcile by billing cycle, transaction type, tenant, or transaction number.
4. If account amounts and Monthly Overview do not match, first confirm that billing cycle, tenant, and transaction type are consistent.

### Open Reconciliation Center for Exceptions

1. Open [Reconciliation Center](../../operator/finance-operations/reconciliation-center/).
2. Select the target billing cycle and click **"Refresh"**.
3. Check unmatched transfers, missing revenue details, and compensation queue.
4. Run bilateral ledger checks or revenue detail rebuild only when needed and after confirming the impact scope.
5. Record only desensitized exception type, count, billing cycle, and related clues.

### Generate or View Settlement Statements

1. Open [Settlement List](../../operator/finance-operations/settlement-list/).
2. Search for the target settlement statement by billing cycle, status, and tenant.
3. If the settlement statement already exists, open details and verify amount, status, and posting confirmation information.
4. If settlement generation is required, confirm that Monthly Overview, Financial Accounts, and Reconciliation Center have no blocking exception.
5. After generation, return to the list, search by billing cycle and tenant, and open details to confirm status.

### Use Account Adjustment if Needed

1. Use [Account Adjustment](../../operator/finance-operations/account-adjustment/) only when the difference source has been located and approval basis is sufficient.
2. Verify adjustment type, affected billing cycle, related documents, amount direction, and approval status.
3. Do not treat reconciliation results alone as adjustment basis; compare them with Financial Accounts, Settlement List, and business records.
4. After adjustment, return to Monthly Overview, Financial Accounts, and Settlement List to verify the result.

## Parameter Quick Reference

| Field Name | Required | Field Type | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Billing Cycle | Yes | Month / financial period | `2026-07` | The unified time scope for this reconciliation and settlement workflow. |
| Tenant | Conditionally required | Text | `Desensitized tenant` | Limits the settlement statement generation or reconciliation scope. |
| Account Type | Conditionally required | Enum | `Platform Clearing Account` | Distinguishes clearing, revenue, or other accounts during transaction checks. |
| Exception Type | Conditionally required | Enum | `Unmatched Transfer` | Determines the next step in Reconciliation Center. |
| Settlement Statement No. | Conditionally required | Text | `Desensitized statement number` | Tracks settlement details, status, and posting confirmation. |

## Pitfalls

- Do not skip Reconciliation Center before generating settlement statements. Unmatched transfers and missing revenue details can affect later verification.
- Financial Accounts, Monthly Overview, and Settlement List must use the same billing cycle and tenant scope.
- Account adjustment is only for located and approved differences. It is not a routine repair entry.
- If settlement generation fails, do not click repeatedly. Review generation checks and failure reasons first.
- `Generate Settlement`, compensation, rebuild, and account adjustment are high-risk actions. Confirm billing cycle, tenant, amount, and approval basis before executing them.
- Do not record real tenants, customers, amounts, transaction numbers, account numbers, settlement statement numbers, Token, or Key.

## Result Validation

| Check Item | Success Signal | If Abnormal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Billing-cycle status clear | Monthly Overview shows the target billing cycle, summary status, and update time. | Continue with tasks and account checks. |
| Blocking tasks handled | Today Tasks has no high-priority task blocking settlement. | Open Financial Accounts. |
| Accounts reconcilable | Financial account transactions explain income, expense, and balance changes. | Open Reconciliation Center. |
| Reconciliation has no blocker | Unmatched transfers, missing revenue details, and compensation queue are handled or have clear conclusions. | Open Settlement List. |
| Settlement statement traceable | The statement can be found by billing cycle and tenant, and details can be opened. | Archive or continue posting confirmation. |
| Difference closed | Adjustment cases have approval, related documents, and verification records. | Return to related pages and retest. |

## FAQ

#### Can I skip Reconciliation Center and generate settlement statements directly?

**Symptom:**

Monthly Overview looks normal, but you are not sure whether Reconciliation Center still needs to be checked.

**Possible cause:**

Monthly Overview shows summary numbers, while Reconciliation Center shows exception clues. They serve different purposes.

**How to handle:**

Before generating settlement statements, refresh Reconciliation Center at least once and confirm that unmatched transfers, missing revenue details, and compensation queue items are not blocking settlement.

#### Settlement statement amount and financial account transactions do not match

**Symptom:**

The amount in settlement statement details does not match income, expense, or balance in Financial Accounts.

**Possible cause:**

Billing cycle, tenant, transaction type, or account type may be inconsistent. Posting confirmation, refunds, adjustments, or clearing delay may also exist.

**How to handle:**

Align billing cycle and tenant first. Then open Financial Account transactions for reconciliation. If the difference is still unexplained, open Reconciliation Center and keep only desensitized clues.

#### When is account adjustment required?

**Symptom:**

After finding a billing difference, you are not sure whether to open Account Adjustment directly.

**Possible cause:**

Account adjustment is a fund-correction action. It requires clear reason, impact scope, and approval basis, and must not be triggered from a single page result alone.

**How to handle:**

Complete checks in Monthly Overview, Financial Accounts, Reconciliation Center, and Settlement List first. Use Account Adjustment only after confirming that the difference is real and requires correction.


#### Can Settlement Generation Continue Before Billing-cycle Data Updates?

**Symptom:**

Monthly Overview or Financial Accounts still shows an old update time, but settlement is about to continue.

**Possible causes:**

- Billing-cycle statistics or posting tasks are not complete.
- Reconciliation Center still has blocking exceptions.

**How to handle:**

1. Stop settlement generation.
2. Check the Monthly Overview update time and Today Tasks.
3. Refresh Reconciliation Center and handle blocking exceptions.
4. Continue only after billing-cycle data finishes updating.

#### Which Records Must Be Kept After the Billing-cycle Workflow Closes?

**Symptom:**

The workflow is complete, but the required result record is unclear.

**Possible causes:**

- The billing cycle and object scope were not recorded consistently.
- Raw screenshots or transaction data contain sensitive information.

**How to handle:**

1. Record the desensitized billing cycle, tenant, or business scope.
2. Record settlement status, exception type, handling conclusion, and review result.
3. Do not record real amounts, accounts, transaction numbers, credentials, or internal handling comments.
## Notes

- Do not generate settlement statements before billing-cycle statistics are complete.
- Do not judge amount correctness from one page alone. Compare Monthly Overview, Financial Accounts, Reconciliation Center, and Settlement List.
- Before Generate Settlement, rebuild, compensation, or account adjustment, confirm billing cycle, tenant, and impact scope.
- Screenshots, tickets, comments, and delivery records must not expose real tenants, customers, amounts, transaction numbers, account numbers, settlement statement numbers, or internal handling comments.
- Account adjustment is a fund-correction action and must follow approval and review procedures.

## Next Steps

1. After the billing-cycle workflow is closed, archive desensitized billing cycle, tenant, settlement status, exception conclusion, and reviewer information.
2. If a settlement statement is in posting confirmation, continue tracking it in [Settlement List](../../operator/finance-operations/settlement-list/).
3. If a new transaction difference appears, return to [Financial Accounts](../../operator/finance-operations/financial-accounts/) and [Reconciliation Center](../../operator/finance-operations/reconciliation-center/) for another check.
4. If account adjustment is involved, verify the result again in Monthly Overview and Financial Accounts.
