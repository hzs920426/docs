# My Deployments

## Feature Overview

| Item | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Applicable Roles | Model Provider |
| Navigation Path | Model Services > Studio > My Deployments |
| Page Route | `/modelone/my-deployments/models` |
| Managed Objects | On-Cloud deployments, On-Prem deployments, deployment status, and publishing entry |

#### Beginner Explanation

My Deployments works like a model deployment register. On-Cloud shows cloud deployments and On-Prem shows deployments in self-managed environments. Confirm the deployment type before reviewing status, resources, and call information.

#### Terminology

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| On-Cloud | A deployment that runs on cloud-platform resources. |
| On-Prem | A deployment that runs in self-managed physical or virtual infrastructure. |
| Deployment Status | The current creation, running, failed, or stopped state of a deployment. |
| Call Information | The URL, protocol, and authentication requirements used after deployment. |

#### Recommended Operation Order

Open the relevant On-Cloud or On-Prem tab, locate the deployment, and review its details. To publish a new model, use the publishing entry and confirm the region before continuing.

#### Beginner Checklist

| Scenario | Do First | Do Not Do Directly |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unsure where a deployment runs | Check both deployment tabs | Query one tab repeatedly |
| Deployment status is abnormal | Review details and status information | Redeploy immediately |
| Preparing to record call information | Use URL and credential placeholders | Put real credentials in documentation |
| Preparing to publish a model | Confirm region and resources first | Submit publication immediately |

## Prerequisites

1. The current account has permission to view `Studio > My Deployments`.
2. At least one deployment record is listed on the page.
3. The target deployment meets the conditions for displaying the publish entry, and `Publish` is visible in the more actions menu.
4. Before publishing, the publish region, visibility scope, billing configuration, and call configuration risks have been confirmed.
5. Before publication, confirm the deployment region, resources, model source, visibility, billing, and rate limits.

::: warning High-Risk Operation Boundary
Publishing a model affects model visibility, call methods, billing, and user access. Before submission, verify the publishing region, business scope, resources, model source, billing, and rate limits.

## Page Description

The page separates deployment locations into On-Cloud and On-Prem. Lists show models, regions, status, and actions. The publishing entry starts a new model publication flow.

## Pitfalls

- My Deployments shows deployment status. It does not mean the model has been published to the marketplace.
- When deployment is abnormal, check Resource Pool, Runtime Image, model asset, and startup logs before submitting again.
- Deleting, stopping, or restarting a deployment may affect Model Consumers. Confirm traffic and rollback path first.

## Result Validation

| Check Item | Success Signal | If Abnormal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page is accessible | The `My Deployments` page opens, and the `On-Prem` and `On-Cloud` tabs are visible. | Check account permissions, navigation path, and page loading status. |
| Deployment list loads | The target deployment card shows deployment name, model name, status, region, and resource specification. | Click **"Search"** or `Reset` and retry. Check filters and deployment permissions if needed. |
| Target deployment status is visible | The target deployment status is shown as the real page status, such as `Running`. | Confirm whether the deployment task is complete, or open `Details` to view deployment status. |
| Publish entry is visible | Eligible deployments show `Publish` in the more actions menu. | Check deployment status, account permissions, and row actions. |
| Publish region can be selected | The `Publish Model` dialog opens and shows `Private`, `Public`, and the corresponding publish buttons. | Close the dialog and retry, or check whether the account has permission for the selected publish region. |
| Redirect target is correct | After selecting a publish region, the page opens the `Publish Model` page under `Model Services > Studio > My Models`. | Check publish region permissions, page route, and browser redirect status. |
| Publish fields are visible | The page shows `Basic Information`, `Billing Configuration`, `Rate Limit Configuration`, and their key fields. | Go back and select the publish region again, or refresh the publish model page. |

## FAQ

#### Deployment List Is Empty

**Symptom:**

The target deployment is missing from On-Cloud or On-Prem.

**Possible Causes:**

- The wrong tab is open.
- Filters or visibility do not match.

**Resolution:**

1. Check both deployment tabs.
2. Reset filters and verify permission.

#### Deployment Details Do Not Open

Opening a deployment returns no details or an error.

**Possible Causes:**

- The record is still being created.
- The record expired or permission is missing.

**Resolution:**

2. Confirm the record exists and the account can view it.

#### Deployment Status Does Not Change

**Symptom:**

Status remains in creating or processing.

**Possible Causes:**

- Resources are not ready.

1. Review stages and errors in details.
2. Ask an authorized operator to inspect the task.

#### Call Information Is Unavailable

**Symptom:**

No call information is listed after deployment.

**Possible Causes:**

- The service is not ready.
- Call permission or network scope is not configured.

**Resolution:**

1. Verify deployment health.
2. Check authorization and network access.

#### Model Publication Fails

**Symptom:**

No deployment record is created after submission.

## Notes

- Publishing a model affects model visibility, call methods, billing configuration, and user access.
- Selecting the wrong publish region may publish the model to the wrong site, region, or business scope.
- `发布 / Publish`, `提交 / Submit`, and `保存 / Save` are high-risk final actions.
- Do not write real accounts, secrets, tokens, AK/SK, Endpoints, API Keys, customer names, pricing strategies, cloud resource IDs, or internal test parameters.

## Next Steps

1. Return to `My Models` to view the publish model configuration progress.
2. Verify the model visibility, billing configuration, and call configuration for the selected publish region.
3. If a real publish action has been performed, open model details or the call page to confirm status and access control.
