#### Beginner Explanation

Tenants is the platform's directory of business entities. It maintains tenants, administrators, roles, tags, and business ownership. Confirm the tenant identity before creating a tenant, changing a role, or investigating billing.

#### Terms Quick Reference

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tenant | A business entity on the platform.; Confirm its unique identity before an action. |
| Tenant administrator | The account responsible for tenant administration.; Verify it before contact or authorization. |
| Tenant role | A permission set available to a tenant.; Confirm the impact before changing it. |
| Tenant tag | A label used to classify tenants.; Use it for filtering and operations. |

## Prerequisites

1. The current account has permission to manage tenants.
2. You have opened `Tenants & Settings > Tenants`.
3. Before creating a tenant or managing its roles or tags, you have confirmed its business identity and authorization boundary.

## Page Description

The tenant list uses the tenant `Name` for display and search. Before opening an action, confirm the target by its `Name`, tenant ID, administrator, and business identity. Tenant names, administrator information, and email addresses are desensitized in the following screenshot.

## Pitfalls

- Do not change roles, members, login policies, Keys, or API rate-control rules without confirming the affected users and systems.
- UI entries can differ by role and tenant scope; verify the current account context before troubleshooting.
- Never copy complete Keys, AK/SK, tokens, or secrets into documentation, tickets, or screenshots.
- Creating a tenant creates a real tenant entity and a fixed administrator account.
- Initial passwords, administrator emails, and phone numbers are sensitive information. Do not write them into documentation or screenshots.
- Role selection affects the platform access scope of the tenant administrator.
- The current UI does not provide an action to turn off the `Provider` business identity after enablement. Confirm the tenant, business owner, and downstream impact before enablement.
- This restriction applies to the `Provider` business identity. The `Manage Roles` dialog can still remove ordinary role tags when permitted.
- Final submission is a high-risk action. Do not submit real tenant configuration during learning or screenshots.

## Result Validation

| Check Item | Success Signal | If Abnormal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filters | The tenant list refreshes according to the selected conditions. | Select Reset and query again. |
| Tags | The list scope changes after selecting a tag. | Check whether any tenant has that tag. |
| Tenant actions | Manage Roles, Manage Tags, and other actions are displayed according to permission. | Check the current account's tenant-management permission. |
| Create page | Clicking `Create Tenant` opens the same-name creation page. | Check whether the current account has tenant creation permission. |
| Learning exit | Real tenant configuration is not submitted when only reviewing fields. | Refresh the list and confirm no test tenant was added. |

## FAQ

#### A target tenant cannot be found

**Symptom:**

The list is empty after searching by tenant name or tenant ID.

**Possible cause:**

The filters are too restrictive, or the business identity, status, or role filter does not match the tenant.

**Resolution:**

Select `Reset`, then search again with fewer filters.

#### What should be checked before changing tenant roles?

**Symptom:**

The page provides a `Manage Roles` action.

**Possible cause:**

Tenant roles control which functions the tenant can use.

**Resolution:**

Confirm the tenant identity, administrator, and business scope, then follow the permission-change process.

#### Why is the target tenant missing from the tenant list?

**Symptom:**

The operator-side tenant page does not show the target tenant.

**Possible cause:**

The tenant was not created, is disabled, or is outside the current operator account's authorized scope.

**Resolution:**

Clear the tenant name, status, and region filters. Confirm the tenant creation record and status. If the tenant is still missing, ask a platform administrator to check tenant authorization.

#### How should the Tenants page be exported or captured safely?

**Symptom:**

Page information is needed for troubleshooting, audit, or delivery.

**Possible causes:**

The page may contain accounts, email addresses, IP addresses, internal paths, tenant identifiers, Keys, or amounts.

**Resolution:**

Keep only the necessary fields and action context. Use opaque light-gray pixel mosaics for sensitive text and never share complete credentials or internal addresses.

#### What should I do when the Tenants page shows unexpected data?

**Symptom:**

A field, status, metric, or related object differs from the expectation.

**Possible causes:**

The page scope, time condition, role permission, or upstream setting does not match.

**Resolution:**

Record the redacted object, time, and result. Verify the entry and filters first, then check related pages and Operation Logs.

## Notes

- The page contains administrator details, email addresses, and tenant IDs. Desensitize screenshots before sharing them.
- Creating a tenant or changing roles can affect the functions visible to the tenant. Confirm the authorization boundary first.
- Creating a tenant creates a real tenant entity and a fixed administrator account.
- Initial passwords, administrator emails, and phone numbers are sensitive information. Do not write them into documentation or screenshots.
- Final submission is a high-risk action. Do not submit real tenant configuration during learning or screenshots.
