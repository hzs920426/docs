## Overview

This document describes how to obtain an `Activation Code` from a `Registration Code` and activate the `AI Infra License` on the `License Management` page.

This workflow applies when a License needs to be activated after an Activation Code is obtained offline or by email. The document describes operating locations, field meanings, and validation methods only. It does not expose any specific Registration Code, Activation Code, or login credential.

## When To Use

- You are activating the `AI Infra License` for the first time.
- You need to obtain an `Activation Code` offline or by email.
- Online License activation is unavailable and activation by code is required.
- A License has expired, capacity has been expanded, or the deployment needs to be authorized again.

## Prerequisites

1. The current account has access to `Billing` and the `Billing > License` page.
2. The current platform deployment has generated a `Registration Code` that can be used to request an Activation Code.
3. The target authorization area has been confirmed as `AI Infra License`.
4. An offline communication channel or email address is available to receive the Activation Code.
5. Complete Registration Codes and Activation Codes will not be exposed in documents, screenshots, tickets, or chats.

::: warning Security Reminder
Do not expose complete Registration Codes or Activation Codes in documents, screenshots, tickets, or chats. An Activation Code is usually bound to the Registration Code of the current deployment and cannot be reused across environments. Clicking `Activate` affects the authorization status of the current deployment, so confirm the target environment and deployment before proceeding.
