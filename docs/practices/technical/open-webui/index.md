# Creating Model Dialogues for The Little Prince Using Open WebUI

## Introduction to Open WebUI

Open WebUI is a scalable, feature-rich, and user-friendly **self-hosted AI platform** designed for completely offline operation. Here's a detailed overview of Open WebUI:

- **Multi-Model Support:** Open WebUI supports various LLM (Large Language Model) runners, such as Ollam and OpenAI compatible APIs, allowing users to quickly switch, load, and manage different local and remote AI models.
- **RAG Pipeline:** A built-in RAG (Retrieval Augmentation Generative) inference engine supports content extraction and processing from videos, documents, or embedded data.
- **Multimodal Support:** Supports various data types of input, including text and images, enriching the interactive experience.
- **Customizability:** Users can customize model parameters, such as temperature and context length, through the model management tool to meet individual needs.
- **Built-in Memory Function:** Allows users to add memories to the model for continued use in conversations, improving the coherence and accuracy of dialogue.
- **Collaboration and Sharing:** Supports local chat sharing and session cloning for convenient team collaboration or personal note-taking.
