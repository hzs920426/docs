3. Configure API Key and API Address
   - _API Key_: Obtain the `Certified TOKEN` from the AGIOne platform model API call page - _API Address_: `https://agione.pro/hyperone/xapi/api` - _Note: CherryStudio will append `/chat/completions` to the end of the URL by default. However, AGIONE request routing is not compatible with this format on the CherryStudio platform. Therefore, users need to enter `#` at the end of the URL to indicate that the appending operation will not be performed._

4. Retrieve the Model List  
    After configuration, go to **Model → Manage** to retrieve the model list (most model providers predefine available models), then select your desired model.
