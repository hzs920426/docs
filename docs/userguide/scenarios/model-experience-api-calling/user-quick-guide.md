# {{DOCS_PRODUCT_NAME_EN}} User Guide for End Users

This guide is written for first-time {{DOCS_PRODUCT_NAME_EN}} users. It walks you through the full basic workflow: signing in, claiming free quota, trying a model in the web playground, and calling the model with curl. Usernames, passwords, and API keys are shown as placeholders only.

## Applicable Roles

- End User trying and calling a model
- Model Provider reviewing the resulting customer call records


## 1. Before You Start

Prepare the following information before using {{DOCS_PRODUCT_NAME_EN}}.

| Item         | Example or Description                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Platform URL | `{{DOCS_PLATFORM_URL_EN}}`                    |
| Username     | `{USERNAME}`                                  |
| Password     | `{PASSWORD}`                                  |
| Model API Key | `{API_KEY}`, copied from the Quick Start page |

This guide uses Qwen3.5-27b as an example. Model availability and provider-instance identifiers can vary by environment.

| Item             | Value                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model Name       | Qwen3.5-27b                                                    |
| Model Identifier | `{MODEL_IDENTIFIER}`                                           |
| Protocol         | `openai/chat_completions`                                      |
| API Endpoint     | `{{DOCS_API_ENDPOINT_EN}}` |

> Provider-instance call identifiers can vary by environment, provider, or region. Copy the identifier shown in the current environment from the selected provider card or `Quick Start` before calling.

If a privacy policy or service terms dialog appears, click `Agree`.

### 2.3 Confirm That Sign-In Succeeded

After signing in successfully, you should see a user avatar or initial in the upper-right corner. The left-side menu should show entries such as `Discover`, `Playground`, `Studio`, `Usage & Earnings`, and `My Calls`.

## 3. Open the Model List

### 3.1 Open Model Services

After signing in, open:

```text
{{DOCS_MODEL_STORE_URL_EN}}
```

You can also navigate through the page menu:

```text
Model Services > Discover > Models
```

### 3.2 Find Qwen3.5-27b

Search for `Qwen3.5-27b` in the model list. The list is sorted by `Newest`, so use the search box instead of relying on the model's position in the current list. After you find it, click `View` on the model row.

![Qwen3.5-27b in the model list](./images/02-model-list-qwen35.png)

## 4. Claim Free Quota

The free quota entry is on the provider card in the model detail page, next to the `Playground` button.

### 4.1 Open the Model Detail Page

After opening the `Qwen3.5-27b` detail page, confirm that you can see the following information.

| Check Item | Expected Value |
| --- | --- |
| Model Name | `Qwen3.5-27b` |
| Model ID | `qwen/qwen3.5-27b` |
| Provider Card Call Identifier | `{MODEL_IDENTIFIER}` |
| Quota Button | `Claim Free Quota` |
| Trial Entry | `Playground` |

![Free quota entry on the model detail page](./images/03-model-detail-claim-quota.png)

### 4.2 Click to Claim

On the provider card, click:

```text
Claim Free Quota
```

After the quota is claimed successfully, the page shows a success message and the button changes to:

```text
Claimed
```

![Free quota claimed successfully](./images/04-quota-claimed.png)

### 4.3 Confirm That the Quota Was Claimed

Any of the following signs means the quota has been claimed successfully.

| Success Sign | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The page shows `Successfully claimed` | The platform has completed the claim |
| The button changes to `Claimed` | The current account has already claimed the free quota for this model |
| The model detail page still shows `Claimed` after reopening it | The claim status has been saved |

## 5. Try the Model in the Web Playground

The web playground is the easiest way to try a model. You do not need to write code.

### 5.1 Open Playground from the Detail Page

On the `Qwen3.5-27b` model detail page, click the following button on the provider card:

```text
Playground
```

You can also open it from the left-side menu:

```text
Playground > Text
```

If you open it from the left-side menu, select the target model manually. If you open it from the model detail page, the current model is usually preselected.

![Text playground page](./images/06-playground-text.png)

### 5.2 Send a Test Message

After entering the text playground page, follow these steps.

| Step | Action | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Confirm `Model Sub-Type` | `LLM` |
| 2 | Confirm or select the model | The provider model for Qwen3.5-27b |
| 3 | Confirm `Protocol` | `openai/chat_completions` |
| 4 | Adjust parameters if needed | Beginners can keep the default values |
| 5 | Enter a question in the input box at the bottom | `Introduce {{DOCS_PRODUCT_NAME_EN}} in one sentence.` |
| 6 | Click the send button | Wait for the model response |

If the generated response appears in the chat area, the playground call has succeeded.

### 5.3 Select the Playground That Matches the Model Modality

The model's capabilities and input/output modalities determine which playground to use. Do not validate image, video, or audio models with text-model parameters.

| Modality | Menu Path | Validate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text / chat | `Playground > Text` | Prompt, Temperature, Top-P, Max Tokens, response, and latency |
| Image / multimodal | `Playground > Images` | Authorized image, prompt, size, count, output image, and request ID |
| Video | `Playground > Video` | Authorized short video, frame sampling, duration, result, and asynchronous latency |
| Speech / audio | `Playground > Audio` | Audio format, sample rate, language, voice, and text or audio output |

For an image model, choose an available image or multimodal model, upload sanitized and authorized material, set the prompt and size, and send the request.

![Select an image playground model](../../../usermanual/model-services/user/playground/images/images/select-model.png)

For a video model, first use a short sanitized sample to validate frame sampling, output format, and asynchronous results before increasing input size.

![Configure video playground parameters](../../../usermanual/model-services/user/playground/video/images/video-list.png)

For an audio model, confirm input format, language, and output type. Do not upload original recordings that contain customer privacy.

## 6. Call the Model with curl

Use curl when you want to call the model from a command line, script, or backend service.

### 6.1 Open the Quick Start Page

Go back to the model detail page and click:

```text
Quick Start
```

On the Quick Start page, you can find the following information.

| Information | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Model ID Call Identifier | The provider-specific value used in the `model` field |
| Base URL | The API service base address |
| Path | The protocol path appended to the base URL |
| Full URL | The complete curl request URL |
| Model API Key | The authentication key selected in the `AUTHENTICATION` section |
| Curl Example | A ready-to-use reference command |

The API key in the screenshot is redacted. In actual use, copy your own API key from the page.

![Quick Start curl example](./images/05-quick-start-curl-redacted.png)

### 6.2 Copy the API Key

Find `Model API Keys` in the `AUTHENTICATION` section, select an authorized key, then click `Copy`.

Please note:

| Note | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Do not share your API key with others | The API key can be used to call models under your account |
| Do not commit it to public documents or code repositories | Store it as an environment variable when possible |
| This guide uses `{API_KEY}` | Replace it with your real key when calling the API |

### 6.3 curl Example

Replace `{API_KEY}` and `{MODEL_IDENTIFIER}` with values copied from the current environment, then run the command in your terminal.

```bash
curl -X POST "{{DOCS_API_ENDPOINT_EN}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "stream": true,
    "model": "{MODEL_IDENTIFIER}",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### 6.4 Confirm That the API Call Succeeded

When the call succeeds, your terminal returns generated model output. Common signs of success include:

| Check Item | Success Sign |
| --- | --- |
| Response content | The response includes generated text |
| Model field | The response includes the current environment's model identifier |
| No authentication error | No `Unauthorized` or `Invalid API key` error appears |
| No quota error | No insufficient quota message appears |

## 6.5 Quick Practice

Go to [{{DOCS_PRODUCT_NAME_EN}} Best Practices]({{DOCS_OPENCODE_URL_EN}}).

## 7. View Your Call Records

To confirm whether the model was actually called, check the call logs.

### 7.1 Open Call Logs

Open the following menu from the left side:

```text
My Calls > Call Logs
```

### 7.2 Filter Call Records

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Select the call time range |
| 2 | Enter the model name or model ID |
| 3 | Select the call status, such as success or failure |
| 4 | Click `Search` |
| 5 | Check the call time, model, status, token usage, and latency in the list |
| 6 | To view more information, click `Details` on the target row |
